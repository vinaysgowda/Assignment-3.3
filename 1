Explain the below concepts with an example in brief.
● Hive Data Definitions

Hive query language. Like all SQL dialects in widespread use, it doesn’t fully conform to any particular revision of the ANSI SQL standard. It is perhaps closest to MySQL’s dialect, but with significant differences. Hive offers no support for row-level inserts, updates, and deletes. Hive doesn’t support transactions. Hive adds extensions to provide better performance in the context of Hadoop and to integrate with custom extensions and even external programs.
Still, much of HiveQL will be familiar.The features of HiveQL using representative examples. In some cases, we will briefly mention details for completeness.The so-called data definition language parts of HiveQL, which are used for creating, altering, and dropping databases, tables, views, functions, and indexes. We’ll discuss databases and tables.
The data manipulation language parts of HiveQL that are used to put data into Hive tables and to extract data to the filesystem, and how to explore and manipulate data with queries, grouping, filtering, joining, etc.
